Hi, I’m @CrespoAlvarezAbdon.

I’m interested in web programming, data processing, machine learning, video game development and almost any type of software development.
I’m currently learning data processing and machine learning at the University of Cadiz (UCA).

Looking to collaborate on: front-end and back-end software development, primarily focused around machine learning, data processing and web services.

Actually working on a custom voxel engine with pseudo-infinite terrain generation. I will upload the first version to a public GitHub repository once it can achieve 
decent performance with complete terrain generation and manipulation.

Non-native B2 English speaker.

Known languages: C++, Java, MATLAB, Python and C#.

Known video game engines: Unreal Engine 4, Unity and GameMaker studio.
