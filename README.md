Hi, I’m @CrespoAlvarezAbdon.

I’m interested in web programming, data processing, machine learning, video game development and web services.
I’m currently learning data processing and machine learning at the University of Cadiz (UCA).

Looking to collaborate on: front-end or back-end software development, primarily focused around machine learning, data processing and web services.

Actually developing a custom voxel engine with pseudo-infinite terrain generation in my free time. I have uploaded the first public version of the code. When everything is more stable I will think about releasing compiled versions of the code for Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04.

Non-native B2 English speaker.

Known languages: C++, Java, MATLAB, Python and C#.

Known video game engines: Unreal Engine 4, Unity and GameMaker studio.
